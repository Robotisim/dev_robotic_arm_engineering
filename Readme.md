# Robotic Arm Engineering — Learning Path

- __Teaching approach__: start with a small __toy arm URDF__ (easy math + debugging), then teach the same concept side-by-side on the __Franka Panda__.
- __Notes__: the core math references live in `Notes/` and are mapped by page number in `docs/Notes Index.md`.
